# Showroom Virtual Template

A high-performance, data-driven Next.js template for creating virtual real estate showrooms. Designed for a "clone-and-fill" workflow, this template allows you to deploy a new project in minutes by simply updating data files and assets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initialization

Follow these steps to set up the project for the first time:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pluska/showroom-template.git your-project-name
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   *Note: Ensure you set at least `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSET_BASE_URL`.*

4. **Initialize Database:**
   This project uses Cloudflare D1. Initialize your local database with migrations and seed data:
   ```bash
   # Generate migrations from schema
   npm run db:generate

   # Apply migrations to local D1 instance
   npm run db:migrate

   # (Optional) Seed the database with initial data
   npm run db:seed
   ```

### 2. Running Locally

Once initialized, you can run the project in development mode:

**Standard Next.js Development:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Cloudflare Pages Environment (Recommended for D1/R2 features):**
```bash
npm run dev:pages
```
The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
