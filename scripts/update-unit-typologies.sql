-- Unit typologies ("5. TIPOLOGÍAS COMPLETO" delivery).
-- NOTE: these values now live in src/data/floors.ts and ship in the generated
-- seed, so this script is only for patching a database in place — it updates
-- the unit rows without the wipe that seeding does.
-- photos_* hold the three views the unit page switches between (amoblado /
-- sin amoblar / plano) and gallery holds the interior renders. The path also
-- tells the unit page which folder to read the transition videos from, so the
-- flats that share a typology (201-301-401, 202-302-402) share one folder.
